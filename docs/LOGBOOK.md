# 🦆 The DuckBox Dev Log

This is where I track what I'm learning, the bugs I've smashed, and the ideas I have for the future.

### 📅 February 20, 2026
**Current Focus:** Interactive UI & System Automation

- **What I did today:**
    - Upgraded the Dashboard UI with a high-tech "Glassmorphism" look using CSS `backdrop-filter`.
    - Integrated **JavaScript Features**:
        - A **Live Clock** and **Dynamic Greeting** based on the time of day.
        - A **Recommendation Terminal** that allows users to submit ideas directly to GitHub Issues.
    - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up `.github/workflows/main.yml` to automate system health checks.
    - **Visual Status:** Added a live GitHub Actions status badge to the dashboard to show the build is "passing."
- **Challenges:** Wiring the "QUACK" button to generate a GitHub Issue URL with pre-filled text.

### 📅 February 19, 2026
**Current Focus:** Expanding the Box (Pixel Art & Python)

- **What I did today:**
    - Created the core folder structure (`assets`, `games`, `sites`, `projects`) using the "Slash Trick."
    - Refactored the `/games` folder into a **Pixel Art Gallery**.
    - Built a "Glassmorphism" style **About Me** page in `/sites/about-me/`.
    - Wrote my first Python projects: `duck_decider.py` and `duck_pass.py`.
    - Updated the main `README.md` with a custom **Duck Theme** and navigation table.
- **Learning:** Mastered relative linking (`../../`) to connect the dashboard to other folders.
