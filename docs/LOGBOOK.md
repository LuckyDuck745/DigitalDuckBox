### 📅 February 20, 2026
**Current Focus:** Advanced UI & Dashboard Features

- **What I did today:**
    - Upgraded the `/sites/index.html` into a **High-Tech Duck Dashboard**.
    - Implemented **Glassmorphism** design (frosted glass effect) using CSS `backdrop-filter`.
    - Integrated **JavaScript Features**:
        - A **Live Clock** that updates every second.
        - A **Dynamic Greeting** that changes based on the time of day.
        - A **Random Quote Generator** for "Duck Wisdom."
    - Added a pulsing "System Status" indicator to make the UI feel alive.
- **Challenges:** Perfecting the CSS Grid layout for the new "Control Center" widgets.

### 📅 February 19, 2026
**Current Focus:** Expanding the Box (Pixel Art & Python)

- **What I did today:**
    - Created the core folder structure (`assets`, `games`, `sites`, `projects`) using the "Slash Trick."
    - Refactored the `/games` folder into a **Pixel Art Gallery**.
    - Built a "Glassmorphism" style **About Me** page in `/sites/about-me/`.
    - Wrote my first Python projects: `duck_decider.py` (logic) and `duck_pass.py` (security).
    - Updated the main `README.md` with a custom **Duck Theme** and navigation table.
- **Learning:** Mastered relative linking (`../../`) to connect the dashboard to other folders.
