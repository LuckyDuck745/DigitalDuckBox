This is where I track what I'm learning, the bugs I've smashed, and the ideas I have for the future.

### 📅 February 20, 2026
**Current Focus:** Visual Polish & Python Tooling

- **What I did today:**
    - Upgraded the Dashboard UI with **CSS Animations**: Added a fade-in for the page and a "float" effect when hovering over cards.
    - **New Projects Added:** - Created `duck_converter.py` for unit conversions.
        - Created `system_check.py` for simulated diagnostics.
    - **Add a Recommendation Box:** Linked a button to GitHub Issues so people can send in ideas.
    - **Bug Fix:** Fixed the 404 errors by using `../projects/` to link the Python files correctly.
    - **CI/CD:** Set up the GitHub Actions "Quack Check" to watch the repo.

### 📅 February 19, 2026
**Current Focus:** Expanding the Box (Pixel Art & Python)

- **What I did today:**
    - Created the core folder structure (`assets`, `games`, `sites`, `projects`) using the "Slash Trick."
    - Refactored the `/games` folder into a **Pixel Art Gallery**.
    - Built a "Glassmorphism" style **About Me** page in `/sites/about-me/`.
    - Wrote my first Python projects: `duck_decider.py` and `duck_pass.py`.
    - Updated the main `README.md` with a custom **Duck Theme** and navigation table.
- **Learning:** Mastered relative linking (`../../`) to connect the dashboard to other folders.
