# 🦆 The DuckBox Dev Log

This is where I track what I'm learning, the bugs I've smashed XD, and the ideas I have for the future.

### 📅 February 19, 2026
**Current Focus:** Expanding the Box (Pixel Art & Python)

- **What I did today:**
    - Created the core folder structure (`assets`, `games`, `sites`, `projects`) using the "Slash Trick."
    - Refactored the `/games` folder into a **Pixel Art Gallery** for my hand-crafted art.
    - Built a "Glassmorphism" style **About Me** page in `/sites/about-me/`.
    - Wrote my first Python projects: `duck_decider.py` (logic) and `duck_pass.py` (security).
    - Updated the main `README.md` with a custom **Duck Theme** and navigation table.
- **Challenges:** Learning how GitHub handles empty folders and mastering relative links (`../../`).
- **Tomorrow's Goal:** Upload actual pixel art files to `/assets` and link them to the gallery.

### 💡 Ideas for the Future
