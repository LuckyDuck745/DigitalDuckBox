# 🦆 The DuckBox Dev Log

This is where I track what I'm learning, the bugs I've smashed, and the ideas I have for the future.

### 📅 February 19, 2026
**Current Focus:** Setting up the DigitalDuckBox Architecture.

- **What I did today:** - Created the core folder structure (`assets`, `games`, `sites`, `projects`).
    - Added `.gitkeep` files to make sure empty folders stay on GitHub.
    - Set up the main `README.md` with navigation links.
    - Built a "Glassmorphism" style About Me page.
- **Challenges:** Learning how GitHub handles empty folders (slash trick!).
- **Tomorrow's Goal:** Add a basic interactive element to the `/games` folder.

### 💡 Ideas for the Future
- [ ] Create a "Duck-themed" clicker game.
- [ ] Add a dark mode toggle to the sites directory.
- [ ] Connect a custom domain to GitHub Pages.
